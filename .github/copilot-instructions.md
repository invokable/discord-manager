# Onboarding Guide: invokable/discord-manager

## Overview

The `invokable/discord-manager` is a Laravel package that simplifies Discord bot development by providing a robust framework for handling Discord Interactions via webhooks. This package serves Laravel developers who want to build Discord bots without dealing with the complexities of Discord's API directly.

**Target Users:** Laravel developers building Discord applications, bots, or integrations

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Webhook Processing**: Automatically receives and validates Discord interaction requests (slash commands, buttons, modals)
- **Command Management**: Provides tools to generate, register, and execute Discord commands with minimal boilerplate
- **Security**: Built-in cryptographic signature validation ensures only authentic Discord requests are processed
- **Async Processing**: Uses Laravel's event system to handle complex command logic without blocking Discord's response requirements
- **Developer Experience**: Includes Artisan commands for scaffolding and deployment, plus a facade for easy API access

**Workflow**: Discord sends interaction webhooks → Package validates and processes → Dispatches to user-defined command handlers → Sends responses back to Discord

## Project Organization

### Core Systems

1. **Webhook Processing Pipeline** (`src/Http/`)
    - Entry point for all Discord interactions
    - Handles signature validation, immediate responses, and event dispatching

2. **Command Management System** (`src/DiscordCommandRegistry.php`, `src/Console/`)
    - Discovers, registers, and executes Discord commands
    - Provides scaffolding tools for developers

3. **HTTP Client Layer** (`src/Facades/`, `src/DiscordCommandRegistry.php`)
    - Manages authenticated requests to Discord API
    - Abstracts Discord API versioning and authentication

4. **Event System** (`src/Events/`, `src/Contracts/`)
    - Decouples webhook responses from command processing
    - Enables asynchronous command execution

### Key Entry Points

- **`DiscordInteractionsServiceProvider`**: Bootstraps the entire package
- **`/discord/webhook` route**: Receives all Discord interactions
- **`DiscordManager` facade**: Primary API for developers
- **`discord:make:interaction`**: Generates new command classes
- **`discord:interactions:register`**: Deploys commands to Discord

### Main Classes & Functions

- **`DiscordManager::interaction(Request)`**: Processes incoming Discord interactions
- **`DiscordManager::http()`**: Returns authenticated HTTP client for Discord API
- **`InteractionsWebhookController::__invoke()`**: Handles webhook HTTP requests
- **`ValidateSignature::handle()`**: Validates Discord request signatures
- **`WithInteraction::followup()`**: Sends follow-up messages to Discord

## Glossary of Codebase-Specific Terms

**CommandNotFountException** - Custom exception thrown when a Discord interaction references an unregistered command (`src/Exceptions/CommandNotFountException.php`)
